# Obsidian templates to import papers from Zotero
This repository contains a set of templates to be used in [Obsidian] to import several types of documents from [Zotero] using the [Zotero integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration) community plugin.

The templates included in the `templates` directory are used for my own work. I just need to import the information I need from several kind of documents I use for my research. Those templates may fit your needs but it is very likely you may need to adjust them to fit your use case.

There is an example use case in the Obsidian vault included in the `examples/vault` directory. You may want to clone this repository and open that directory as a vault in Obsidian. It includes the _Zotero integration_ plugin already installed and you only need to enable community plugins. The vault already includes the templates and som examples notes imported from my own Zotero instance. You will only need to have Zotero installed in the same machine as youtr Obsidian installation.
